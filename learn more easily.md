# how to write more clearly?
## why we need to write more clearly
- people who write are powerful
- influence peoply by writing things for them to read
- clear writing leads to clear thinking
- You don't know what you know until you try to express it
- writing nonsence is thinking nonsence

## 方法
- do what's easy for your reader

### Planning
- every section has its purpose, and is broken down into smaller sections each of which has its purpose
- 假如刚开始你不能恰当地组织文章的顺序，那就将你想写的所有内容先写下来，之后再去排序和组织。你不用通过linear order去写文章。

### Drafting
- 将脑海中的内容写下来，不用管合不合理，通不通顺，就只要写下来即可
- 在 drafting 阶段不用管语法，格式之类的问题
- 将注意力集中到你想表达的想法上，并思考如何组织它
- **直接说到点子上**
- To keep things clear and readable: 直接陈述主要观点，之后在解释。
- To keep things clear and readable: 将主要观点直接放在每一段的第一句
- K.I.S.S (Keep it simple, stupid!) 总是使用最简单，最清晰的语言。

### Revising
- the goal of the revising step is to make your writing clearing and easier to read
- 保证每个段落的首句都是这个段落的总结性描述。
- 简短 简短

### Editing
- 检查语法，拼写，标点符号
